Mobile phone lines in Sudan were cut on Wednesday and internet services disrupted as protesters gathered across the capital Khartoum and other cities to once again denounce last month’s military coup. Thousands of people chanted "no to military power" in defiance of a crackdown that has already claimed 24 lives. In several places, security forces began firing tear gas as people carried pictures of those killed. Several briges linking Khartoum with other cities were closed.
