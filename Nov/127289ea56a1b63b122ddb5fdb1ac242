More than 100 countries were set to pledge Tuesday to end deforestation, which scientists say is a major driver of climate change. Britain hailed the commitment as the first big achievement of the UN climate conference in Glasgow. But campaigners say they need to see the detail as they say that  such promises have been made, and broken, before. The UK government said it has received commitments from leaders representing more than 85% of the world’s forests to halt and reverse deforestation by 2030. 📢 NEWS: At COP26, over 100 leaders have committed to halt and reverse forest loss and land degradation by 2030."To have any chance of keeping below 1.5°C of global warming, we must halt deforestation" -- Sir David AttenboroughLearn more:👉 https://t.co/KEQU6kbnaS#COP26 pic.twitter.com/uTSR63qw7L More than $19 billion in public and private funds have been pledged to the plan, which is backed by countries including Brazil, China, Colombia, Congo, Indonesia, Russia and the United States. Forests are considered important ecosystems and an important way of absorbing carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas, from the atmosphere. But the value of wood as a commodity and the growing demand for agricultural and pastoral land are leading to widespread and often illegal felling of forests, particularly in developing countries. Campaign group Human Right Watch cautioned that similar agreements in the past have failed to be effective. Luciana Tellez Chavez, an environmental researcher at the group, said strengthening Indigenous people’s rights would help prevent deforestation and should be part of the agreement. Deforestation is the second largest source of greenhouse gas emissions. A new #COP26 agreement could change that – but will it have what it takes to deliver results?

Prime Minister Boris Johnson described global warming as “a doomsday device” strapped to humanity. U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres told his colleagues that humans were "digging their own graves". And Barbados Prime Minister Mia Mottley, speaking for vulnerable island nations, added moral thunder, warning leaders not to “allow the path of greed and selfishness to sow the seeds of our common destruction.” Climate activist Greta Thunberg told a rally outside the high-security climate venue that the talk inside was just “ blah blah blah" and would achieve little. @GretaThunberg "no more #BlaBlaBla What's happening here outside of #cop26 : this is what leadership looks like". pic.twitter.com/TlWgziu38A “Change is not going to come from inside there,” she told some of the thousands of protesters who have come to Glasgow to make their voices heard. "That is not leadership, this is leadership. This is what leadership looks like.” (With agencies) Daily newsletterReceive essential international news every morning Keep up to date with international news by downloading the RFI app
