Senegal's Foreign Minister Aissata Tall Sall says she hopes China will lend support in the fight against insecurity in the Sahel region at opening of a China-Africa summit in Dakar. Speaking on Sunday following a meeting with her Chinese counterpart Wang Yi, Sall said she hoped China would become a "strong voice" in combatting terrorism in the vast Sahel region. Islamist militants are active across much of the Sahel, waging a conflict that has continued for years despite the presence of French troops and United Nations peacekeepers. Sall's statement came at the start of a China-Africa summit in Senegal, which is due to focus on trade matters as well as security. It ends on Tuesday.
