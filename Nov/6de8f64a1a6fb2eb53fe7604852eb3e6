There’s Paris Perspective, Africa Calling, Spotlight on France, and of course, The Sound Kitchen. We have a bilingual series - an old-time radio show, with actors (!) to help you learn French, called Les voisins du 12 bis. And there is the excellent International Report, too.

Teachers, take note! I save postcards and stamps from all over the world to send to you for your students. If you would like stamps and postcards for your students, just write and let me know. The address is english.service@rfi.fr   If you would like to donate stamps and postcards, feel free! Our address is listed below. Another idea for your students: my beloved music teacher from St Edward’s University in Austin, Texas, Br Gerald Muller, has been writing books for young adults in his retirement – and they are free! There is a volume of biographies of painters and musicians called Gentle Giants, and an excellent biography of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. They are also a good way to help you improve your English - that’s how I worked on my French, reading books which were meant for young readers – and I guarantee you, it’s a good method for improving your language skills. To get Br. Gerald’s free books, click here. RFI Clubs: Be sure to always include Audrey Iattoni (audrey.iattoni@rfi.fr) from our Listener Relations department in all your RFI Club correspondence.

Everyone can look at it, but only members of the group can post on it. If you haven’t yet asked to join the group, and you are a member of an independent, officially recognised RFI English Club, go to the Facebook link above and fill out the questionnaire!!!!! (if you do not answer the questions, I click “decline”). There’s a Facebook page for members of the general RFI Listeners Club, too. Just click on the link and fill out the questionnaire, and you can connect with your fellow Club members around the world. Be sure you include your RFI Listeners Club membership number (most of them begin with an A, followed by a number) in the questionnaire, or I will have to click “Decline”, which I don’t like to do! This week’s quiz: On 9 October, I asked you a question about France’s decision to allow primary school children in 47 departments across France to attend classes mask-free. On 4 October, the government announced that any French administrative department where the number of Covid cases had dropped to less than 50 per 100,000 people was eligible to become a “green level” department, the lowest health protocol level. Although children were no longer required to wear masks to school in those regions, teachers were required to keep wearing them. Currently, one Covid case in a classroom leads to the closure of the entire class. My question to you was, as of 1 October, what was the percentage of France’s classrooms which were closed due to Covid, according to the French Education Ministry? The answer is: On 1 October, according to the Education Ministry, 1,692 classes were closed due to Covid, representing 0.32 percent of the country's classes. Unfortunately, Covid cases are on the rise again. In October, in 47 of France’s 101 administrative departments, schoolchildren were allowed to attend school mask-free. That number has now dropped to 40. The winners are: Muhammad Shamim S., the president of the Golden Eagles RFI Club in Keralam State, India; the president of the RFI Butterflies Club Ain Kechera, Ferhat Bezazel from West Skikda, Algeria, and two RFI Listeners Club members from Bangladesh: Haridas Roy from Panchagarh, and Shadman Hosen Ayon from Kishoreganj. Last but not least, there’s Riaz Hussain from District Chiniot, Pakistan, who is also an RFI Listeners Club member. Congratulations winners! Here’s the music you heard on this week’s programme: “Lullaby of Birdland” by George Shearing and George David Weiss, performed by George Shearing; “Le plus beau des foules” by David Lewis Luong, played by the composer with accordionist Yuri Ryadchenko; “The Flight of the Bumblebee” by Nicolai Rimsky-Korsakov; “African Savannah” by Derek and Brandon Fiechter, and “Allah Hoo” by Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan.
