The concert by Congolese artist Werrason scheduled on Saturday 25 September in Paris has been banned by the French authorities, who fear "serious disturbances" to public order between supporters and opponents of the regime in Kinshasa. "The concert is taking place in a particularly tense and violent political context between supporters and opponents of the current regime," Paris police chief Didier Lallement said in an order published on Monday. According to the French authorities, the concert is causing "increasing mobilisation among radical Congolese opponents in the diaspora living in France" because Werrason is "considered close" to former President Joseph Kabila and his successor Felix Tshisekedi. ⚠️ INFO - WERRASON ⚠️Suite à une décision de la Préfecture de Police, le concert de @Werrason_001 prévu le 25 septembre 2021 au #ZenithParis est annulé.
