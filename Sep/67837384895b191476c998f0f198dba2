This week on The Sound Kitchen you’ll hear the answer to the quiz about Zambia’s new president. There’s a “sonic postcard” from the IUCN World Conservation Congress in Marseille, France, where RFI hosted the winners of the Planète Radio ePOP video competition, which included the first anglophone winner, Adita Prithika Subramanian from Tamil Nadu, India.  There’s listener news, and of course, the new quiz question, too. Just click on the “Audio” arrow above and enjoy! Hello everyone! Welcome to The Sound Kitchen weekly podcast, published every Saturday – here on our website, or wherever you get your podcasts. You’ll hear the winner's names announced and the week’s quiz question, along with all the other ingredients you’ve grown accustomed to: your letters and essays, “On This Day”, quirky facts and news, interviews, and great music … so be sure and listen every week. I am busy cooking up special shows with your musical requests, so get them in! Send your musical requests to thesoundkitchen@rfi.fr  Tell us why you like the piece of music, too – it makes it more interesting for us all! Be sure you check out our wonderful podcasts! In addition to the breaking news articles on our site, rfienglish.com, with in-depth analysis of current affairs in France and across the globe, we have several podcasts which will leave you hungry for more. There’s Paris Perspective, Africa Calling, Spotlight on France, and of course, The Sound Kitchen. We have a bilingual series - an old-time radio show, with actors (!) to help you learn French, called Les voisins du 12 bis. And there is the excellent International Report, too. As you see, sound is still part of the RFI English service!  Keep checking our website for updates on the latest from our excellent staff of journalists.

Teachers, take note! I save postcards and stamps from all over the world to send to you for your students. If you would like stamps and postcards for your students, just write and let me know. The address is english.service@rfi.fr   If you would like to donate stamps and postcards, feel free! Our address is listed below. Another idea for your students: my beloved music teacher from St Edward’s University in Austin, Texas, Br Gerald Muller, has been writing books for young adults in his retirement – and they are free! There is a volume of biographies of painters and musicians called Gentle Giants, and an excellent biography of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. They are also a good way to help you improve your English - that’s how I worked on my French, reading books which were meant for young readers – and I guarantee you, it’s a good method for improving your language skills. To get Br. Gerald’s free books, click here. RFI Clubs: Be sure to always include Audrey Iattoni (audrey.iattoni@rfi.fr) from our Listener Relations department in all your RFI Club correspondence.

This week’s quiz: On 21 August, I asked you a question about Zambia. On 16 August, Zambia’s Electoral Commission announced the winner of the presidential poll, which was held on 12 August. The opposition candidate won, and I asked you to write in with the name of the now-president of Zambia - he was inaugurated on 24 August. You were also to tell me the name of his political party and the percentage of votes he won, according to the Zambia Electoral Commission. The answer is: Hakainde Hichilema. Hichilema, a businessman-turned-politician, has vied for the top office in the country five times. His party is called the United Party for National Development. Zambia’s Electoral Commission announced that Hichilema received 2.8 million votes, or 58 percent, over incumbent Edgar Lungu’s 1.8 million votes. The winners are: Ferhat Bezazel, the president of the RFI Butterflies Club Ain Kechera in Ain Kechera, Algeria. There are RFI Listeners Club members Shaira Hosen Mo from Kishoreganj, Bangladesh, and Sagor Mia, also from Kishoreganj – he’s the president of the “Let's Go on the Right Path and Tell the Truth Radio Listener Club”. Finally, there are faithful RFI English listeners Bernard Egbe from Abuja, Nigeria, and Rahim Khan Sahta from Rajasthan, India. Congratulations winners!
