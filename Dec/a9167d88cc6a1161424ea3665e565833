French tennis chiefs on Thursday appointed the former women's world number 1 Amélie Mauresmo as director of the French Open until 2024. The 42-year-old replaces Guy Forget, who oversaw the second Grand Slam tournament of the tennis season from 2016. “I am extremely proud and honoured to be given the reins of this tournament, which symbolises so many memories in my personal and sporting life,” Mauresmo said. “I’ve accepted this position as tournament director with clear ambitions. I will carry them out with the same high standards, freedom and passion that have always driven me.” 🧡 @AmeMauresmo a une grande histoire avec le tournoi de @rolandgarros...

Gilles Moretton, the FFT president, said he was seeking a new look for the clay court season's most prestigious tournament. "Amélie is a great champion, she has an international influence - that of a woman of character who likes a challenge and to be challenged," he said. "Amélie has an identity, she has the charisma to lead the project of renewal.” Decision to delay 2021 French Open saves 'millions of euros'  	The French tennis diva who revolutionised the women's game During her career, Mauresmo reached the last eight of her home Grand Slam tournament in 2003 and 2004.
