France reported a record high of 179,807 new confirmed coronavirus cases in a 24-hour period, one of the highest one-day tallies worldwide since the start of the pandemic. However, despite the jump in new cases, the number of patients in hospital with Covid-19 remains moderate. The number of Covid patients in intensive care units (ICU) was around 3,400 on Tuesday evening, well below the highs of more than 7,000 in early April 2020. According to data on Covidtracker.fr, the figure represents the highest number of new daily infections in Europe. Since the start of the pandemic, only the United States and India have reported average daily new cases above 200,000. On Monday, the United States reported more than 505,000 new Covid-19 cases. Meanwhile, Britain reported a record 129,471 new cases of Covid-19 on Tuesday, but the data did not include figures for Scotland and Northern Ireland due to differences in reporting practices over the Christmas holiday period.
