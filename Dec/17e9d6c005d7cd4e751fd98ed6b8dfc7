In addition to the breaking news articles on our site, rfienglish.com, with in-depth analysis of current affairs in France and across the globe, we have several podcasts which will leave you hungry for more. There’s Paris Perspective, Africa Calling, Spotlight on France, and of course, The Sound Kitchen. We have a bilingual series – an old-time radio show, with actors (!) to help you learn French, called Les voisins du 12 bis. And there is the excellent International Report, too. As you see, sound is still part of the RFI English service! Keep checking our website for updates on the latest from our excellent staff of journalists.

You can either listen directly or subscribe and receive them directly on your mobile phone. To listen to our podcasts from your mobile phone, slide through the tabs just under the lead article (the first tab is “Headline News”) until you see “Podcasts”, and choose your show. Teachers, take note! I save postcards and stamps from all over the world to send to you for your students. If you would like stamps and postcards for your students, just write and let me know. The address is english.service@rfi.fr   If you would like to donate stamps and postcards, feel free! Our address is listed below. Another idea for your students: my beloved music teacher from St Edward’s University in Austin, Texas, Br Gerald Muller, has been writing books for young adults in his retirement – and they are free! There is a volume of biographies of painters and musicians called Gentle Giants, and an excellent biography of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. They are also a good way to help you improve your English - that’s how I worked on my French, reading books which were meant for young readers – and I guarantee you, it’s a good method for improving your language skills. To get Br. Gerald’s free books, click here. RFI Clubs: Be sure to always include Audrey Iattoni (audrey.iattoni@rfi.fr) from our Listener Relations department in all your RFI Club correspondence. Remember to copy me (thesoundkitchen@rfi.fr) when you write to her so that I know what is going on, too. N.B.: You do not need to send her your quiz answers! Email overload! And don't forget, there is a Facebook page just for you, the RFI English Clubs. Only members of RFI English Clubs can belong to this group page, so when you apply to join, be sure you include the name of your RFI Club and your membership number. Everyone can look at it, but only members of the group can post on it. If you haven’t yet asked to join the group, and you are a member of an independent, officially recognised RFI English Club, go to the Facebook link above and fill out the questionnaire!!!!! (if you do not answer the questions, I click “decline”). There’s a Facebook page for members of the general RFI Listeners Club, too. Just click on the link and fill out the questionnaire, and you can connect with your fellow Club members around the world. Be sure you include your RFI Listeners Club membership number (most of them begin with an A, followed by a number) in the questionnaire, or I will have to click “Decline”, which I don’t like to do! This week’s quiz: On 4 December, I asked you a question about Sweden. On 24 November, Sweden elected their very first female prime minister, the leader of the center-left Social Democratic Party. However, it only lasted about seven hours. She resigned because her budget was defeated in Parliament, and her coalition partner quit out of frustration.  So, this history maker resigned as well, saying: “According to constitutional practice, a coalition government should resign if one party leaves the government. For me, it is about respect, but I also do not want to lead a government where there may be grounds to question its legitimacy.” So that was that. No leader in Sweden. Until … parliament re-elected her on 29 November. I asked you to send in her name. The answer is: Magdalena Andersson. Andersson is Sweden’s former finance minister, a post she held from 2014 until she became prime minister. Sweden is the last of the Nordic countries to have a woman as prime minister – Finland, Iceland, Denmark – and Estonia, as RFI English Club member Arne Timm reminds us – all have women running their countries. The winners are: Mr. Manik Hossain, who is a member of the Shetu RFI Listeners Club in Naogaon, Bangladesh, and three RFI Club members: Richard Wasajja from Masaka, Uganda; Alan Holder from the Isle of Wight, England, and Hans Verner Lollike from Hedehusene, Denmark. Last but not least, there’s RFI English listener Princess Honour Serena Dokubo from Port Harcourt, Nigeria, who is a member of the Radio Zeater Club. Congratulations winners! Here’s the music you heard on this week’s programme: “The Christmas Song” by Robert Wells, sung by Nat King Cole; “I’m Dreaming of a White Christmas” by Irving Berlin, sung by The Drifters; "Sommarpolska" by Roger Tallroth, performed by Tallroth and the trio Väsen; “The Flight of the Bumblebee” by Nicolai Rimsky-Korsakov, and “Cascabel” by James Lord Pierpont, arranged and translated into Spanish by Andrés Alén, and performed by Ritmo Latino.
