Salah Abdeslam, the main defendant in the trial of the 13 November 2015 attacks has tested positive for Covid-19, calling into question whether the court hearings will resume on schedule. The only survivor of the jihadist group who killed 130 people in Paris and Saint-Denis in 2015, is being held for the duration of the hearing in the Fleury-Merogis prison south of the French capital. Believed to be the largest prison in Europe, a total of 21 inmates have reportedly tested positive for Covid-19 as of 24 December. Nationwide, 370 of the estimated 70,000 prisoners have been infected with the coronavirus. 🇫🇷 FLASH | Salah #Abdeslam a été testé positif au #COVID19.
