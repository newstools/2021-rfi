Players and top flight rugby clubs led the tributes on Tuesday to the Stade Rochelais foward Kévin Gourdon who announced his retirement due to a heart problem. The 31-year-old France international was told he was at risk if he continued to play professionally. "It's brutal and sad news,” Gourdon said in a statement. “But my health is a priority. Unfortunately I'm not in a position to do anything to make the situation different, so I have no regrets.” Le troisième ligne international français âgé de 31 ans, Kévin Gourdon, a appris cette semaine qu’un problème cardiaque le contraint à mettre un terme immédiat à sa carrière sportive.https://t.co/aEXFrCXjOK Gourdon joined Stade Rochelais in 2012 when the club was in the Pro D2.
