Omar Sy, the star of Netflix global hit "Lupin" about a French gentleman thief, has signed a multi-year deal to act and develop films for the streaming giant, the company said Tuesday. The deal announced by Netflix did not specify any financial terms or specific projects for the deal with the actor-comedian who is set to star in and produce multiple feature films. It is the first such Netflix deal with a French talent or filmmaker, according to Variety. Sy said he was "very happy to have the opportunity to extend the relationship" with Netflix, praising the streamer's "collaboration with artists and their passion to bring unique and diverse stories to homes all over the world." "We look forward to working together with Omar and his team as he grows as a producer and brings more unique stories and voices to Netflix," said Netflix France's Gaelle Mareschi in the statement. In Lupin Sy plays Assane Diop, a fan of the novels who uses the character of Lupin as he seeks vengeance for his wrongly-accused father. The debut of the French-language TV mystery is Netflix's third most-watched season ever after Squid Game and Bridgerton, earning 76 million views in its first month, according to internal figures. A second batch of episodes was released in June, with more eagerly awaited adventures based on the early 20th-century cat-and-mouse novels of Maurice Leblanc to follow. The 43-year-old Sy became famous in The Intouchables before appearing in Hollywood blockbusters X-Men: Days of Future Past and Jurassic World. Last month he was the only Frenchman to be included in Time magazine's list of the 100 most influential people on the planet.
