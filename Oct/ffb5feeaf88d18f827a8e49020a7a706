An incest commission in France on Wednesday made three recommendations calling for the “better protection of children”, saying accusations of sexual abuse by a parent were too often brushed aside. Since its creation in March, the Independent Commission on Incest and Child Sexual Abuse (Ciivise) has received hundreds of reports from desperate mothers whose children have confided episodes of abuse by fathers. Instead of being heard by institutions, the mothers are suspected of manipulating their child into damaging the reputation of the father – most commonly in instances of spousal separation.

"We’re safeguarding the child,” Ciivise co-president judge Édouard Durand told AFP. Each year, nearly 22,000 French children are victims of sexual violence committed by their father, but in only 1,697 people were prosecuted in 2020, the commission found.
