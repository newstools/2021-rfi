Paris Saint-Germain fans will be banned from travelling to Marseille for Sunday's Ligue 1 contest after several French matches were marred by violence in recent weeks, the Interior Ministry said Wednesday. "Away games by the PSG club often disrupt public order" while "certain" Marseille fans "often display violent behaviour," the ministry said. Individual or group travel by PSG supporters will also be prohibited starting at midnight Saturday because relations between the clubs "have been tainted with animosity for several years," it added.

Marseille has been involved in the violence more than once. Earlier this month, fans at the Stade Velodrome lobbed fireworks, smoke bombs and other projectiles toward supporters of the Turkish club Galatasaray, sparking clashes both during and after the match.
